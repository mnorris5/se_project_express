# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. In creating this project I've used databases, set up security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote machine. this project was created using Node.js and MongoDB. It uses routes and controllers to put, post, get, and delete, all tested with postman.
